# Finished Product

## Introduction

Our intern Dan has finished working on this killer Movie Quotes App that returns a random movie quote.

Please run `npm install` and then run `node index.js` in your terminal to start the server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser to view random movie quotes.
Refresh your page to get new quotes.
